# My Flesh and Blood Resolution: An Old School Tournament Report

## Preamble

At the end of last year, whilst I was on holiday, I noticed a number of “Flesh and Blood Resolution” posts on X, the everything app 🤣. I was discussing this with my friend Tom and we came to the conclusion that most of these posts were a bit silly.

**Examples** – “I Top 8ed a Calling this year, my goal is to win a Calling.”

To me, this goal in the context of a TCG is just a bit silly as so many factors are out of your control. Better goals in my opinion are actionable ones, such as:

**Example** – “I want to test matchups thoroughly so I don’t end up in a tournament playing a matchup I have zero experience in.”

Now you may be wondering why a tournament report begins with me yapping about a New Year's social media trend. Well, I decided that what I would set as my “Flesh and Blood Resolution” would be to write an old school tournament report! I am forever moaning about the fact that nobody writes tournament reports anymore, mostly due to Vlogs/YouTube.

Now, I didn’t get around to doing this until the Calling Sydney due to honestly just laziness, even though I went to a number of PQ/RTNs, The Calling Sydney, and Australian Nationals.

## Report: The Road to Sydney

![My Verdance Decklist](Kassai.png)

To start off the report I want to briefly talk about the three PQ events I played leading up to the event.

### PQ #1 Mint – 34 Players

I started off the PQ season playing **Kassai**, as I mistakenly thought that there would be a strong Brute contingent. With the new tools Kassai has gotten recently with the **Gold Fable** and **Blood Follows Blade**, it seemed like a reasonable pick.

I ended up going **3-3**, beating Marlynn, R Kayo, and Dawnblade Dori, and losing to Marlynn, Florian, and Oscilio.

My housemate Tom D ended up winning this event on Kayo which was pretty exciting.

### PQ #2 Mana Market – 25 Players

![My Verdance Decklist](Verdance.png)

After the not-so-stellar results and the realization that Brute was not going to be that popular, I swapped back to **Verdance** which I had played at Nationals. There had been a bit of talk about running no potions and just relying on 3x **Tree** to get you over the line, but honestly I think this is a little suspect and the potions are incredibly useful.

I had been trying to fatigue Gravy since picking up the new list with **Talishar** and blue **Sirens**.

*   **Round 1 – Jacob – Gravy (Win):** As GEM is wont to do, Jacob and I are paired R1 and we get to play this riveting matchup. The pivotal moment was when he played a Map and his second card was a Boat, which allowed me to just fatigue him.
*   **Round 2 – Henry – Verdance (Win):** We were both on potions but I was able to pitch two early **Rampants** and combo first.
*   **Round 3 – Luis – Kayo (Win):** I drew extremely well and there wasn’t much he could do against **Fellings** / Arcane.
*   **Round 4 – Lach – Cindra (Loss):** Lach absolutely rolled me; I wasn’t able to resolve any **Fellings**.
*   **Round 5 – Joey – Prism (Loss):** He played an early **Library** which is never good, but a few turns later I was actually able to kill it. It didn’t end up mattering as I was still too far behind on board and he ran me over.

With the 3-0 to start I was locked anyway, though the losses definitely hurt with how important play/draw is in this format.

*   **Top 8 – Lach – Cindra (Win):** The rematch into Lach was basically the opposite of Swiss. I just rolled him with multiple **Fellings** + **Shelters**.
*   **Top 4 – Madeline – Gravy (Win):** I got an early Ring out which is super important in the matchup, and she didn’t seem super prepared for the fatigue gameplay.
*   **Finals – Alex – Oscilio (Loss):** He found his combo early which is always hard to deal with; as Verdance you really need them to stumble a little at the start. His follow-up turns were all very good as well and the match wasn’t particularly close. Ah well, onto the next.

### PQ #3 GG Spring Hill – 24 Players

This was a hot one! Not only was the aircon not working but the field was full of Cindras.

*   **Round 1 – Luis – Rhinar (Win):** He started off with a **Blood Rush Bellow** but it wasn’t a particularly strong one and I was still extremely healthy. This let me start pushing some offense and I chipped him down into kill range.
*   **Round 2 – Patrick – Verdance (Win):** He wasn’t on potions and I was able to just set up and combo him.
*   **Round 3 – Mia – Dawnblade Dori (Win):** Mia presented AB0 aiming to race me, but I kept drawing strong defensive hands + arcane damage so it was very hard for her to progress and I did 40 with arcane.
*   **Round 4 – Freeman – Gravy (Win):** He was very shocked when I flipped up **Talishar** as last time I played him I just tried to tempo kill him. The game was going fairly well and then he played an early **Wailer**. Thankfully, I was lucky enough to have drawn an Amp 1 card and had a **Light up the Leaves** in arsenal, so I was able to **Storm Striders** and kill it. From there the game was tight but pretty manageable and I fatigued him.
*   **Round 5 – Louis – Dash I/O (Win):** This was a close one but I was able to get him to a spot where he had to tap out to threaten me, and **Storm Striders** just got there.

*   **Top 8 – Patrick – Verdance (Win):** The rematch from round 2. I was pretty confident going into it knowing he didn’t have the potions, but this game ended up being pretty close. He was taking a lot more damage to present damage back, recognising that he couldn’t win a longer game. I was able to setup the pots and combo him; he popped Stormies in response but I was able to pitch one of the **Rampants** and live, and he died.
*   **Top 4 – Tom – Cindra (Win):** The game started off fairly rough when Tom was able to take all my cards with an **Art of War**. I was able to claw back the game and it ended up being dead close but I just got there.
*   **Finals – Louis – Dash I/O (Win):** Super close game with Louis hitting lots of items off the top and not giving me much room to keep cards. But, as with the Swiss game, I was able to chip him down. On a key turn he made a minor misplay that allowed me to keep my last card and play the **Felling** I had in arsenal, which got him into lethal range.

**Invite to Yokohama secured.** The Gold Foil was **Beaten Trackers** which I promptly traded Tom D for his **Cintari Saber** he got from the first PQ.

After two successful weeks on Verdance I was feeling pretty ready for Sydney.

## Sydney: The Calling

On the Friday we hopped in two side events and one thing became abundantly clear to me: fatiguing Gravy was not on the cards for this event. Walking around the tables looking at Verdance vs Gravy games I kept seeing one card over and over: **Remembrance**. This was also demonstrated to me in my Round 3 of the first event where my opponent, Tan, waited until his deck was about 10 blues and nothing else and then shuffled in 3 Boats.

**Talishar out.**

### The Calling

*   **Round 1 – Ryan Hill – Cindra (Win):** Of course Round 1 I have a local in Ryan. I went first and got to burn/race him and started on the front foot. It ended up being very close as he had some very strong turns, but I just got there.
*   **Round 2 – Vinh Luong – Kassai (Win):** Honestly I didn’t play particularly well here. He played an **Imperial Warhorn** and the very next turn popped it and sent a double **Spoils of War** 10–5 swing with no d-reacts from me. I blocked one sword and took the other, losing my arsenal and donating him 4 Coppers. Thankfully he never drew another **Blood on Her Hands** so I was able to chip him down to Stormies range.
*   **Round 3 – Ben Dodd – R Kayo (Loss):** I had played a Man Sant playing R Kayo on Friday so I had the matchup fairly fresh, but it was only the one game. I started trading back and forth, trying to get him into combo range. It became fairly obvious that he didn’t have any **Argh... Smash!** which meant I actually had a chance. Unfortunately for me, two of my potions were in the last hand before my stack so I had one less potion in play when I got there. He knew and CNC’d me on the turn I was going to go off, forcing me to pitch away a **Rampant**. This was where I made a mistake: I should have just popped all my pots and pushed him to a really low life total and played out an endgame with **Storm Striders**, but I got greedy and tried to wait for a better combo. I just ended up dying. Lesson learned.
*   **Round 4 – Patrick Watt – Rhinar (Loss):** I have vsed Pat a few times now and I don’t think I’ve won any of them; this is a good matchup though so I was fairly optimistic. Unfortunately for me he was going crazy, hit all his **Blood Rush Bellows** and rolled two AP on Scabskins the one turn he rolled. The real killer though? Well, that was his last Blood Rush: Claw for 5, I block with chest and a NAA, he pitches **Tear Asunder**, Claw for 5. Well that Tear killed me as I really needed my **Rootbound Carapace** in arsenal to live and Felling him.
*   **Round 5 – Bill Loizos – Marlynn (Win):** Bit of a roll from my end. He never found a NAA Harpoon and I was able to keep cards to pressure him + early ring.
*   **Round 6 – Thomas Caserta – Dash I/O (Win):** He attempted to full setup into me, however I had really good offensive hands with **Enlightened Strikes**. By the time he was attacking me he was way too low and I was able to kill him with Stormies.
*   **Round 7 – Pan Fennir – Fang (Loss):** Win and in to Day Two and I get a Fang! My lucky day I thought… hah. I drew a lot of d-reacts early and then none in the mid/late game. He was able to get online reasonably quick which I cleared with **Scour**, but he just as quickly got back to three Fealties. I got him to 9 which unfortunately is 2 life too high into AB1 and he killed me. I think ultimately the big mistake I made was being overly greedy with **Tree** and taking too much damage; even then the amount of damage he was presenting was really high.

**4-3.** Not the worst, but for my matchup spread and how I had been performing up till now it was fairly disappointing. Now to have some skewers, get over it, and play some **Ball Lightnings**.

## Sydney: The Battle Hardened

![My Verdance Decklist](Aurora.png)

I had planned on playing Chane or Viserai as they seemed like the strongest decks, plus I have played both a lot. The Tuesday before the event, LSS decided to ban Thorn which really put me off the idea. Not because they would be bad choices, but because I was mad that I couldn’t play my GF Thorn!

Because of this, I defaulted back to the deck I’ve played the most in LL: **Aurora**. I play her extremely combo-heavy with probably 25 null blocks in the deck, maximising the **Arc Lightning** / **Ball Lightning** combo.

The event was pretty small at 40 players.

*   **Round 1 – Lois Shum – Dash I/O (Win, 1-0):** Lois, who I had vsed just the week before in the finals, was my R1 opponent with a wild Dash I/O deck. He was all-in on the combo running Resets, Tomes, Brains, AoW, and Stubbies. Warmongers put in work and he bricked slightly on the combo which let me keep my hand and kill him.
*   **Round 2 – CYK Lionel – Viserai (Loss, 1-1):** His hands at the start had a lot of attack actions and he was mostly blocking out and setting up. I didn’t see an Arc/Ball combo and he double Mordred Sonata’d me for what had to be 60+.
*   **Round 3 – Andreas Andrnicou – Prism (Win, 2-1):** I got to live the dream this game. Arc Lightning -> Tome from arsenal -> Ball Lightning -> Ball Lightning. It was enough to nearly kill him and put him into the deathloop. Shortly after, the game was mine.
*   **Round 4 – Bill Huynh – Briar (Win, 3-1):** *[Editor's Note: Win via race condition]*
*   **Round 5 – Patrick Sharpe – Dash I/O (Win, 4-1):** Once again I’m vsing my local Pat. We start off joking around when he flips a Null Time Zone off the top and doesn’t know if "Arc Lightning" is the actual name of Arc Lightning. I start off the game with an E-Strike into a Warmongers which stunts his progress. I’m able to deal a bunch of damage with some good Ball Lightning turns and take the game.
*   **Round 6 – Chien Joon Tan – Starvo (Loss, 4-2):** This matchup is tough. I think it has improved compared to when I was playtesting for Worlds last year, but it's still not great. This game ended up being a pretty good one though as I made it super close without any big Arc/Ball combos. I was fairly sure I was still in the Top 8 even with the second loss, but I was a bit nervous.

**Top 8 – Chien Joon Tan – Starvo (Loss)**

Well, Top 8 was secured, but my inability to win the last game came back to bite me as I had to go for the rematch. I would like to say that this game was a nailbiter, but alas, quite the opposite. Right out of the gate my opponent was fusing, and that seemed to continue for most of the game.

## Conclusion

Well that's that. Overall I’m pretty happy with my season. I have small regrets that I didn’t play as well as I know I am capable of in the Calling, but I'm looking forward to the next one.
